# Chapter 02 Exercises

## Exercise 1

Write a console app that calculates a userâ€™s Body Mass Index (BMI):

- Prompt the user for their height in meters and weight in kilograms
- Calculate the BMI as weight / height^2
- Output a message: underweight (BMI < 18.5), overweight (BMI >= 25), or
healthy
- Structure your code so that pure and impure parts are separate

## Exercise 2

Unit test the pure parts

## Exercise 3

Unit test the overall workflow using the function-based approach to abstract away the reading from and writing to the console
