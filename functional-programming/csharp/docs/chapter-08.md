# Chapter 08 Exercises

## Exercise 1

Implement `Apply` for `Either` and `Exceptional`.

## Exercise 2

Implement the query pattern for `Either` and `Exceptional`. Try to write down the signatures for `Select` and `SelectMany` without looking at any examples. For the implementation, just follow the types — if it type checks, it’s probably right!

## Exercise 3

Come up with a scenario in which various `Either`-returning operations are chained with `Bind`. (If you’re short of ideas, you can use the favourite-dish example from chapter 6)

Rewrite the code using a LINQ expression.
